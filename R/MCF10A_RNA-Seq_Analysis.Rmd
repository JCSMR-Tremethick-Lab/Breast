# Introduction
Purpose of the analysis:

* Determine differential expression in human breast epithelial cell lines MCF10A/MCF10Aca1a
* Following conditions were used
    + **MCF10A WT** vs **MCF10A TGFb-treated** (induction of EMT)
    + **MCF10A WT** vs **MCF10A H2A.Z** knock-down (induction of EMT/effects of siRNAi mediated gene silencing)
    + **MCF10A WT** vs **MCF10ca1a WT** (normal breast epithelial cells vs RAS-transformde, cancerous cells)
    + **MFC10Aca1a WT** vs **MCF10Aca1a shZ** (effects of siRNAi mediated gene silencing)
  
Two biological replicates were used for each condition and libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Next-Seq 500 sequencer using Illumina TruSeq protocol, 76bp PE. The sequencing reads were pre-processed and aligned to the human reference genome hg38-based Ensembl Version 84 transcriptome annotation using STAR. Actual transcript quantification was performed using kallisto against and index built from Ensembl 84 (all cDNAs + ncRNAs). The sequencing data processing pipeline is implemented using snakemake <https://bitbucket.org/snakemake/> and can be found at <https://github.com/JCSMR-Tremethick-Lab/Breast>.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Things to do for paper revision
## illustrate enrichment achieved by using the capture array
* sub-sample equal proportion of reads from each library (in order to adjust for sequencing depth)
* visual approach: plot promoter coverage
* numerical approach: calculate coverage for promoter regions
* this should illustrate that for a given sequencing depth, the capture approach yields x-fold more coverage in promoter regions, i.e. increased sensitivity(?)/resolution
